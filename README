This repository contains all the various parts needed to bootstrap the
following:
 - mescc-tools (https://github.com/oriansj/mescc-tools), containing:
  - M1
  - blood-elf
  - get_machine
  - hex2
  - kaem
 - M2-Planet (https://github.com/oriansj/M2-Planet)
 - mes-m2 (https://github.com/oriansj/mes-m2).

It bootstraps all these from a single 357 byte seed (which you will find in the
folder bootstrap-seeds). The ultimate goal is for this to bootstrap all the way
up to GCC. This will happen when mes-m2 is finished.

There are only two "missing" parts that are not source code; a shell/kaem, and a
kernel. Kaem is a very basic build tool that basically evaluates a very simple
script. A seed kaem that was hand written in hex0 (737bytes) is available as
kaem-optional-seed in the same folder with the hex0 seed. Otherwise, you can use
a shell you trust. The kernel issue is not yet solved and at the moment the
kernel is trusted.

This repository currently supports AMD64 (x86_64), x86 (i386) and AArch64
architectures. To run the entire bootstrap process in the safest way, cd into
the respective directory for your architecture -- AArch64 for AArch64, AMD64 for
amd64 and x86 for x86/i386 -- then run the matching following command:
`../bootstrap-seeds/POSIX/AMD64/kaem-optional-seed`
`../bootstrap-seeds/POSIX/x86/kaem-optional-seed`
`../bootstrap-seeds/POSIX/AArch64/kaem-optional-seed`
This uses the kaem seed rather then relying on your shell.

At this stage of the bootstrap process we use a very minimal kaem. It does not
support all of the same arguments and features as full kaem.
Does support:
 - Line comments
 - String collection
 - Execution of commands
Does not support:
 - `--verbose` (forced ON)
 - `--strict` (forced ON)
 - `-f` (remove -f file should be first argument if any)
 - cd
 - set
 - etc etc etc
The C code matching its behavior is in "High\ Level\ Prototypes/kaem-minimal.c"
It should only be used for the first stages of the bootstrap process.

The bootstrappable effort is all about trust. You should verify each of these
programs, from the hex0 monitor up to mes-m2, along with the kaem seed and the
kaem.run files if you can. There are some efforts to attempt to make it easier
to verify these binaries. This is done primarily by re-writing the lowest level
programs in assembly, so that you can recompile them, checking the hashes
match. If they do, verify only the higher-level source since you know that
source has the same instructions as the lower-level source.

This repository utilizes submodules, so you need to clone this repository using
`git clone --recursive`. If you have already cloned it run `git submodule update
--init` or after a pull be sure to do: git submodule update --recursive

Note that this README may not answer all your questions. If you are still left
wondering things like What is a kaem.run?, see the other repositories readme's
which might answer some more tool-specific questions.

We hang out on the freenode IRC network in the #bootstrappable channel.

|-----------------------------|
| How does this process work? |
|-----------------------------|

It is highly recommended that after reading this you go through the kaem.run for
your architecture and see each of these steps in action. Note that the kaem.run
is split into two kaem files to make it simpler to grasp. These two files are
mescc-tools-mini-kaem.kaem for Phase 0-9 (uses the simple kaem),
mescc-tools-full-kaem.kaem for Phase 10-12 (uses the full kaem for the rest of
mescc-tools) and mes-m2.kaem for Phase 13, contained in the same folder as
kaem.run.

ALL of these steps have a NASM or GAS version in the NASM/ or GAS/ subdirectory
of the folder for the architecture.

Phase 0: Rebuild hex0 from the hex0 seed. This is done to ensure that the hex0
seed is untainted, and that the hex0 seed matches the compiled hex0 source. You
should check these are identical!

Phase 1: Build hex1 from the Phase 0 hex0. hex1 is a more advanced version of
hex0 with support for single character labels and a single size of relational
jumps (hex0 has no support for labels or calculated relational jumps).

Phase 1b: Build catm from Phase 0 hex0. catm is a program removing the need for
cat or redirection by implementing equivalent functionality; eg
cat input1 input2 ... inputN > output_file would be replaced by
catm output_file input1 input2 ... inputN

Phase 2: Build hex2-0 from hex1. hex2 is the final version of the hex* series
adding support for long labels and absolute addresses. This allows it to
function as a linker for later parts of the bootstrap. However for now we are
only building a basic version to make the process simpler, hence the -0 on the
end of the name; as this hex2 only works for the single host architecture it was
built upon.

Phase 3: Build M0 from Phase 2 hex2-0. M0 is an architecture specific version of
M1 which will come later. It is simply a temporary binary that avoids the need
to write a cross-architecture assembler in hex2, as M0 supports just enough
functionality to build the next few stages.

Phase 4: Build cc_* from M0. cc_architecture is a per-architecture C compiler
written in the same architecture's M0. Eg, there is cc_amd64 for amd64 and
cc_x86 for x86. It implements only an extremely basic form of C that is used to
bootstrap the next phase.

Phase 5: Build M2-Planet from cc_*. M2-Planet is another C compiler that
implements a slightly larger subset of C. However this is not an easily
debuggable version and is replaced towards the end.

Phase 6: Build blood-elf-0 using M2-Planet. blood-elf adds dwarf stubs to a
M1 program allowing us to create more easily debuggable programs. However, this
version is not debuggable (as it is built without dwarf stubs) and is indicated
by such with -0 on the end.

From here on in, all the remaining phases are not intermediate binaries and are
used as results. Note that we have been using hex2-0 for the whole time up until
now. Also note that now all binaries are debuggable, can generate stack traces,
etc, thanks to blood-elf.

Phase 7: Build M1 implementation in M2-Planet. M1 is a cross-platform version of
M0, along with being much more powerful and faster.

Note that now we are not using M0; it is replaced with M1.

Phase 8: Build hex2 implementation in M2-Planet. This version of hex2 is
cross-platform and has a number of outstanding features which are out of scope
here. This is a useful linker that is used in the next stage of the bootstrap
process.

Note that from now we no longer need catm, as hex2 and M1 have support for
multiple inputs; hex2-0 is replaced with hex2.

Phase 9: Build kaem. kaem is what was being used to run kaem.run scripts, and
is useful for later stages of the bootstrap process outside this repository.

Phase 10: Build blood-elf implementation in M2-Planet. blood-elf was discussed
earlier and now can be used properly to create debuggable programs with ELF
headers.

Phase 11: Build get_machine. get_machine finds the architecture of the system it
is running on, used for architecture dependent scripts used later in the
bootstrap process.

Phase 12: Build M2-Planet from M2-Planet. This is the same M2-Planet as
discussed earlier, it just is built using itself and so is going to work more
quickly and reliably.

Phase 13: Build Mes-M2 using M2-Planet. Mes-M2 is a re-implementation of Mes
(https://www.gnu.org/software/mes/) designed to make mes part of the
bootstrap process. After this is complete, we will be able to bootstrap our way
up, through MesCC and TinyCC up to GCC.
